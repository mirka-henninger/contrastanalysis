Contrast Analyses
================

This R-packages allows to perform contrast analyses for independent samples, dependent samples will follow soon. In addition to standard contrast analyses, methods are provided to test two competing hypotheses can be tested against each other. All functions and explanations are based on Rosenthal, Rosnow, & Rubin(2000) as well as Sedlmeier and Renkewitz (2008).

Contrast analyses are a sensible alternative to standard variance analyses as it allows to test specific, directed, a priori hypotheses. This leads to results that are easier to interpret and effects can be detected with a higher power.

The package can be installed using the devtools-package:
----------------------------------------------------------

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mirka-henninger/contrastanalysis")
library(contrastanalysis)
```
